# Job-Skills-Project
This was a project I did for a class. I'm graduating this spring and I wanted to know what skills were most desired by companies. I have data for Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Business Analyst.

My main take away from this project is that I need to learn SQL ASAP!!!
